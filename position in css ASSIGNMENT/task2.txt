                                     POSITION IN CSS ASSIGNMENT 
 TASK 2 : Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positionin.   
 SOLUTION : In CSS, absolute positioning places an element relative to its parent's position and changes the layout around it. 
 Relative positioning places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it. 
Absolute positioning defines the position of a given bounding box from the top and left side margins of the web page.
 Relative positioning defines the positioning in such a way that elements are offset from the previous element in the HTML 
  code .

  TASK 5 :
  SOLUTION : When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.
The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, 
or behind, the others).An element can have a positive or negative stack order .
